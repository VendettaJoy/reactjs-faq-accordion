## My process

### Built with

- Love â™¥
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is my first FEM project that I've completed using React JS! I wanted to use my current knowledge of React JS to see whether I could recreate the accordion and have it function exactly like it should, and see how it compares to a solution coded in vanilla JS. While the logic remained the same, the approach toward a solution was obviously different and it tested my understanding of React JS and all it has to offer. I've also gotten a better handle on using SVGs now and that's mostly through a lot of trial and error. 

### Continued development

I want to continue challenging myself with bigger and more complex projects as I continue on this journey of mastering React JS one project at a time.

### Useful resources

- [Vanilla JS Accordion (YT Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr8Emho-kYo): Since I've never made an accordion before, I wanted to see how one would approach it using only vanilla JS
- [React JS Accordion (YT Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGpZrr32ECw): After watching the above YT tutorial, I tried my hand at recreating the accordion in React JS and reached a solution that, while not optimal, still gets the job done. This tutorial came in handy after, when I wanted a more learned approach and used it to streamline my solution
- [React JS Accordion (Blog Post)](https://www.codewithfaraz.com/react/107/create-accordion-in-react-js-with-demo-and-source-code): I also referred to this blog post while optimizing my solution
- [Clamp (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp): When I saw this CSS function in action, I knew I wanted to try using it in my project! It negates having to retype most styles in media queries and it also makes scaling so much smoother (visually, of course)
